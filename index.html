		<h2>PROBLEM</h2>
		<h3 class="section-head">Impulsive buying is making us drown in our own unused stuff</h3>
		<p>As of 2018, 49% of the purchases made by 18-24 year olds were impulsive. Unplanned purchases made at the spur of the moment. Consequently, an average of 100,000 items are hoarded inside every house; when 80% of those items are used less than once a month. From a community point-of-view, we are drowning in our own unused stuff.</p>
		<p>This led us to ask if we really need to own these things or would it be enough if we just had access to them?</p>
		<p>This is my story of designing “ShareSquare”- a social media platform that empowers neighbours to share and consume things collaboratively.</p>

		<h3 class="section-head" style="text-align: center;">My Role</h3>
		<div style="text-align: center;">
			<p>The project was done at the UX Design Bootcamp in Infosys Mysore from September to November 2019. I was part of a 4-member team involving Retail Experience, Visual & UX Designers. We approached the project in a 6-week design sprint, based on the design thinking methodology.</p>
		
			<p>I got involved in various aspects of the process: from conducting initial user research and defining key personas, comparative analysis, laying vision, till preparing wireframes &  hi-fidelity prototypes along with my team.</p> 

			<p>Our retail experience(Suman Sahoo) & visual designer(Aayushi Ramtekkar) helped us with branding and visual design of the platform.</p>

<div style="background-color: #F5F5F5;"><!--The Challenge-->
	<div class="container section">
		<h2>The Challenge</h2>
		<h3 class="section-head">Sharing over Buying</h3>
		<p>In the last decade, a new wave of peer-to-peer access driven businesses have shaken a range of established categories:
		<ul>
			<li>Hospitality and Dining: CouchSurfing, Airbnb, Feastly, LeftoverSwap</li>
			<li>Automotive and Transportation: RelayRides, Uber, Lyft, Getaround, Quickride</li>
			<li>Media and Entertainment: Amazon Family Library, Spotify, SoundCloud</li>
		</ul> 
		<p>This signalled a robust appetite among consumers for the sharing based economy. However, very few ventures(OLX, Rentomojo) explored the Retail & Consumer Goods segment in the market.</p> 
		<p>Our challenge was to persuade people to consider sharing as an option for items they are used to buying without even putting in a second thought.</p>

<div style=""><!--Comparative Analysis-->
	<div class="container section">
		<h2>COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS</h2>
			<h3 class="section-head">High sense of community, low access to resources</h3>
			<div class="row">
			<div class="col">
				<p>The comparison was made on the basis of two most important value propositions offered by any P2P sharing model: sense of community & access to assets. This helped us identify the problems related to our problem space and position ourselves accordingly.</p>
				<ul>
					<li>We wanted to give a high sense of community, for increased belongingness towards the assets.</li>
					<li>But, to give them a limited access to resources just when they require them to fulfil their goal; suffice the ad-hoc requirements of people.</li>
				</ul>

<div style="background-color: #F5F5F5;"><!--User Insights-->
	<div class="container section">
		<h2>USER INSIGHTS</h2>
		<h3 class="section-head">Picking up the pieces</h3>
		<p>We conducted quantitative and qualitative research to drive our planning phase. These are the key insights that guided us towards our final product:</p>
		<div class="sub-section">
			<h4>A penny saved is a penny earned</h4>
			<p>Residents realize that a lot of things are left unused in their homes. Some even consciously pickup a cheaper alternative for less used things.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="sub-section">
			<h4>Buying without a second thought on e-commerce platforms</h4>
			<p>Our secondary research revealed that e-commerce websites use various features that affects consumers’ urge to buying impulsively. So we conducted an online survey with residents to know if they’re aware of the impulsive buying behavior while browsing through online stores.</p>
			<figure>
					<img class="img-spacing" src="chart.png" style="width: 30%" alt="comparative analysis">
					<figcaption class="caption" style="text-align: left;margin:0; width: 30%">Responses to when I go online shopping, I buy things I had not intended to purchase
					</figcaption>
				</figure>
		</div>
		<div class="sub-section">
			<h4>Staying socially active</h4>
			<p>Some residents sought out to connect with neighbours on a regular basis( e.g. while walking their dogs, taking kids to playing area, strolling in the common area). Some even accepted to have befriended those who were just strangers once.<p>
			<p>However, on having big picture of the connectedness between the neighbours in a society we knew much more could be done.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="sub-section">
			<h4>Desire to give back</h4>
			<p>Residents that had received help from their neighbours in the past always had a desire of reciprocating back those favours in any form(even if it’s not immediately).</p>
		</div>	
	</div>
</div>

<div style="background-color: #F4FAFF;"><!--The Discovery-->
	<div class="container section">
		<h2>THE DISCOVERY</h2>
		<h3 class="section-head">What’s beyond money?</h3>
		<p>We had a preconceived notion that having access at a low price & earning easy money would be enough to motivate the people for sharing things. However, this turned out to be a fool’s gold when our research suggested that although people were aware of the fact that sharing helps them save money; it wasn’t a driving factor that could build a habit of sharing.</p>

		<p>The emotional/personal value attached to somethings was much more than the monetary incentives that could be offered.  So there had to be a driving factor beyond money.</p>
	</div>
</div>

<div style=""><!--The Vision-->
	<div class="container section">
		<h2>THE VISION</h2>
		<h3 class="section-head">To be a place where neighbours get to know & interact with each other by sharing their belongings safely & conveniently.</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>place Sharesquare that gives an opportunity to open up to their neighbours in a more humane, subtle manner.</li>
		<li>neighbours of a particular housing society/colony so that it’s easy to build a habit; ensure a sense of responsibility.</li>
		<li>know & interact with neighboursy giving them an excuse to ring each others bell and help each other push themselves out of the solitary boxes.</li>
		<li>sharing as an experience; making it less transactional and more emotional.</li>
		<li>safely & conveniently ensuring safety of the thing being shared & convenience of both the parties being involved in sharing</li>
